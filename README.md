# How to reduce vulnerabilities in a system
## Introduction
This report is about the vulnerabilities during development and how to reduce the amount of vulnerabilities during the development stage of a product or application. It will also go over what a vulnerability is and what is means when it is found or created during development.

## What happens during development?
The development process is used when creating a product of application and is always used during this stage. The development process is when the game is created from a basic state to the final product.

The development of a product or application involves a lot of stages which will add certain features and unique man into the application or product. For example, in the reboot games Elevator action reboot project development will involve splitting up the development process into developing the different features of the game into parts. Such as the jumping feature being created in one step and the next step being enemy AI. (https://github.com/HORNETJOE/Capstone-Project)

## Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities are discovered when creators leave errors, unfinished or mistakes are left in a final product. These vulnerabilities can lead to many different problems such as cheating, data theft etc. These vulnerabilities can be devastating to a company if they are discovered within a system. These vulnerabilities can cost companies thousands if they are discovered after the final product has been released. Therefore, these vulnerabilities need to be reduced during the development stage which will cost the company less and still reduce the amount of vulnerabilities on the final system.

## Example of vulnerabilities being used in a business environment.
One example of vulnerabilities being taken advantage of in a business would be Dailymotion hack that took place December 2017. The incident involves millions of user’s emails and private information being leaked online due to a vulnerability on the website. This is one example of how a vulnerability can impact the company (I.E reputation) and impact the customer as well (I.E Private information).

## Social engineering
Social engineering is a method of seeking out a vulnerability in a system that require human error to create a vulnerability to then exploit. This may involve tricking employees at a company to allow outside user’s access to their systems through misleading emails, ads and messages. Once the outside users have gained access to their system they have created a vulnerability in the system for others to use to gain access as well. This vulnerability relies heavily on human fault and misjudgement to gain access to a system.

## What can be done to reduce vulnerabilities?
There are many different methods of reducing vulnerabilities, many are done during the development process of a system. One method of reducing vulnerability is to run tests on new functions that are implemented into the system to make sure that they work on their own and with the other function in the system. Other method of reducing vulnerability is to have different people working on different parts of the system so that the different parts of the system can be sixed by different people and different people can work on each part of the system while it is in development.

Another way of reducing vulnerabilities would be to reduce the gap between an employee’s personal life and their work life by giving them work emails and work equipment. These will only be used in the work environment. This will reduce the chance of misleading emails or infected hardware from being used in the workplace and infecting the system and creating vulnerabilities.

## Case studies
### Case study 1  
The Dailymotion data breach is a good example for vulnerabilities that can be exploited in a system. The website Dailymotion which is a video-sharing technology platform, was hacked by an unknown group/individual. The breach was carried out on the 20th of October and was announced and made official in November. The damage was over 18.3 million private emails and password were leaked onto the web.
Dailymotion acted on this breach by informing all of it customers of the breach and advising them to take suitable measures to change information and details on their accounts.

### Case study 2
Another example of vulnerabilities that have been exploited in a business would be Equifax data breach that happened in September 2017. This data breach exposed people’s private information such as social security numbers, names, addresses and in some cases driving licence numbers. This data breach also effected people in the Uk and Canada also. Equifax realised this information to the public after the incident happened.

## Primary research
Primary research involves gathering new data that has not been collected before. For example, surveys using questionnaires or interviews with groups of people in a focus group which has been done below.

### Questions
#### The image below is the list of questions that were answered on the questionnaire.

## Analysis
After the information has been gathered we can use Analysis to make a result from the results above for this analysis it would be easier to focus on one section of the results mainly these questions here:
![question3](https://github.com/HORNETJOE/Research/blob/master/question3.PNG)

![question7](https://github.com/HORNETJOE/Research/blob/master/question7.PNG)
The answer is labelled 1 - 3 for the first question and 1 - 5 for the second question. These were the two more important questions that needed to be answered for this research. they were used to determine weather if people knew about the vulnerabilities that could affect them (In this case the first option "Lack of password strength") and if people also admitted that although they knew that having a weak password could act as a vulnerability to their system they still have weak passwords despite knowing the risk. This analysis shows that people know about the risks that involve having a weak password but continue to do so even through using the same password i.e. worrying more about remembering the one password rather than multiple passwords at once, or by having multiple passwords each one not a strong as they could be.

This can be displayed better in the graphs below.

![chart](https://github.com/HORNETJOE/Research/blob/master/questions7and7chart.PNG)

In the chart above the information is displayed is a bar chart which shows the following: for the first question on the chart (Q2 = Question2) it is clear that more people out of the twelve-pick option two what was the "Lack of background image" option which was the correct answer to the question "Which of these would not be a vulnerability?". The first option was "Passwords that lack Strength (i.e. weak passwords)" Which only 3 out of the 20 picked, although 3/20 people think lacking password strength is not a vulnerability, majority of the people picked the right answer showing that they understand what a vulnerability is and that lacking a strong password is a vulnerability to a system.

On the second question located on the right of the bar chart ladled Q7 (Question 7) The choices were mixed mainly with option 2 and option 4. The question was a personal question so the answers would have varied between each person making this a normal outcome however if we decide that option 3 and above are the answers that should be picked (because it would mean that they have medium to strong passwords.) then 7 out of 13 people believe that their passwords are not strong enough to protect them. Although that majority of people believe they have strong passwords and understand that lacking password strength is a vulnerability the other people still understand that lacking password strength is a risk to a system, however still continue to use and willing know that they are using passwords that could pose a vulnerability to their system.

## conclusion
In conclusion, the research that was gathered was to see if people knew what vulnerability are to a system as well as if these same people admit to causing these vulnerably to appear on their system even when knowing the danger. The results in the tables and the graphs show that most people are aware about the risks and vulnerability, in this case lack of password strength, however a worrying large amount of those same people still create those vulnerability on their system. The cause of the problem can be simplified to users creating passwords that are easy to remember for themselves rather than creating a password to protect their system/data. A solution to this problem can to be increase the minimum requirement for creating passwords i.e. all passwords must contain a symbol and uppercase letter, lowercase letter and numbers. Another simpler solution would be to remind users to create a secure password and to also recommend way to remember their complex password to give them ease of mind on how to remember and they can focus more on creating a more complex and secure password.
## Self-reflection
After this report was finished I am able to look back on how the research was carried out and what could be done to improve the results or the information to begin with and to use this new learning experience to carry out and more profitable outcome for the research.

When referring to the research gathering, it would of been a better to have more specific questions as well as simple questions to get a more accurate answer in the end. The research that was carried out more complex questions put into it to see if any of the participants had any knowledge about the subject but not to have all the question be complex to avoid confusing the participant and having them lose interest in the research gathering process.

Another improvement that could be made would be to add a lot more questions into the research gathering. Even though not all the questions would of been used in the final outcome more useful questions would be increase useful when drawing up a conclusion to the report.

Another improvement would be to include a way for the participant to be put into a group by having them state certain attributes about them such as skill level, age and interest.

in conclusion to this self-reflection there was a lot to improve upon and a lot has been learnt while performing the gathering of the research and the analysis of the data gathered. The conclusion to the report was also a positive as the information was used to determine why people allow vulnerability to appear on their systems while also being aware of the dangers that can occur.
